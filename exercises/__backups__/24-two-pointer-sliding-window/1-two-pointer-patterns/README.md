# Two Pointer Pattern Problems

## Overview
The two pointer pattern uses two indices to traverse data, avoiding nested loops and achieving O(n) time. These are among the most frequently asked interview problems.

## Learning Objectives
- Validate palindromes with character filtering
- Solve container with most water (greedy + two pointer)
- Find triplets summing to zero (sort + two pointer)
- Remove duplicates in-place with slow/fast pointers

## Concepts
1. **Opposite Ends**: Start pointers at both ends, converge
2. **Sort First**: Sorting enables efficient two-pointer search
3. **Slow/Fast**: Fast scans ahead, slow marks write position

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- "exercises/24-two-pointer-sliding-window/1-two-pointer-patterns/solution.test.js"
```

## Difficulty: Medium
