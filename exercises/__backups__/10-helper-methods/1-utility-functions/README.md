# Utility Functions

## Overview
Utility functions are reusable helper functions that perform common operations. Mastering these helps you solve problems more efficiently and write cleaner code.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement common array utility functions
- Understand different approaches to solving the same problem
- Learn performance implications of different implementations

## Concepts
1. **Array Search**: Finding if a value exists (linear search, includes method)
2. **Counting**: Tallying occurrences of values
3. **Deduplication**: Removing duplicate values from arrays

## Functions to Implement

### contains(arr, value)
Check if a value exists in an array.

### countOccurrences(arr, value)
Count how many times a value appears in an array.

### getUnique(arr)
Return an array with only unique values from the input array.

## Tips
- Use built-in methods like `includes()`, `filter()`, `Set`
- Consider performance for large arrays
- Handle edge cases like empty arrays
