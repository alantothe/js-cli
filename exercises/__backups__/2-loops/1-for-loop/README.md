# For Loop

## Overview
A `for` loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times. It's the most common loop construct for iterating a known number of times.

## Syntax
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // code executes 10 times
}
```

## Key Concepts
- **Initialization**: Set the starting value (`let i = 0`)
- **Condition**: Check if loop should continue (`i < 10`)
- **Increment**: Update the variable (`i++`)
- Simple and predictable
- Great for iterating through arrays and ranges

## Exercises
Practice using for loops to:
- Count and print numbers
- Sum values
- Build multiplication tables
- Reverse strings
- Calculate factorials
- Work with nested loops

## Run Tests
