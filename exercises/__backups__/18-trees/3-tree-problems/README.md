# Common Tree Interview Problems

## Overview
These are the most frequently asked tree problems in technical interviews. Each one tests a different aspect of tree manipulation and recursive thinking.

## Learning Objectives
- Invert (mirror) a binary tree
- Compare trees for equality and symmetry
- Find lowest common ancestor in a BST
- Calculate maximum depth

## Concepts
1. **Tree Inversion**: Recursively swap left and right children
2. **Tree Comparison**: Simultaneously traverse two trees
3. **LCA in BST**: Use BST property to navigate left or right
4. **Depth Calculation**: Max of left/right subtree depths + 1

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- "exercises/18-trees/3-tree-problems/solution.test.js"
```

## Difficulty: Medium
