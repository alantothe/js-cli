# HackerRank Warm-Up Challenge

## Overview
These introductory problems help you get familiar with HackerRank's problem-solving environment and basic coding patterns.

## Learning Objectives
- Get comfortable with implementing basic algorithms
- Practice reading problem requirements carefully
- Learn to handle edge cases
- Build confidence before tackling harder problems

## Problems

### countCharacter
Count how many times a specific character appears in a string.
- Consider case sensitivity
- Handle empty strings

### sumToN
Find the sum of all integers from 1 to n.

**Example:** sumToN(5) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

**Efficient approach:** Use the formula n * (n + 1) / 2

## Tips for HackerRank
- Read the problem statement multiple times
- Identify input/output formats
- Test with provided examples
- Consider edge cases (empty input, single element, large numbers)
- Optimize for time and space if needed
- Don't submit until all examples pass locally

## Common Patterns
- String manipulation
- Mathematical calculations
- Array operations
- Counting and aggregation
