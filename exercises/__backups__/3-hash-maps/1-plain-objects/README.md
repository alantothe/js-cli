# Plain Objects as Hash Maps

## Overview
JavaScript objects can be used as simple hash maps (dictionaries) to store key-value pairs.

## Key Concepts
- Keys are strings (or can be converted to strings)
- Values can be any type
- Access via dot notation (`obj.key`) or bracket notation (`obj['key']`)
- Simple and lightweight

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- "solution.test.js"
```

## Difficulty
**Easy**
