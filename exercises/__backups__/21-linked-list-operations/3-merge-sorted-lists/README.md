# Merge & Remove Linked List Operations

## Overview
Merging sorted lists and removing nodes by position are classic linked list operations that test pointer manipulation skills.

## Learning Objectives
- Merge two sorted linked lists using dummy head technique
- Remove the Nth node from the end using two-pointer gap

## Concepts
1. **Dummy Head**: Simplifies edge cases when building a new list
2. **Two-Pointer Gap**: Advance one pointer N steps ahead, then move both

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- "exercises/21-linked-list-operations/3-merge-sorted-lists/solution.test.js"
```

## Difficulty: Medium
