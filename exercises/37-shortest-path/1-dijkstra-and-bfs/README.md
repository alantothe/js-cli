# Dijkstra & BFS Paths

## Overview
Shortest-path problems are standard in interviews. Know when to use BFS vs Dijkstra.

## Learning Objectives
- BFS shortest path in unweighted graph
- Dijkstra for weighted graph
- Network delay style single-source max shortest path
- Reconstruct path using parent pointers

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- "exercises/37-shortest-path/1-dijkstra-and-bfs/solution.test.js"
```

## Difficulty: Medium
