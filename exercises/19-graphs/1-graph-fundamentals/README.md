# Graph Fundamentals

## Overview
Graphs represent relationships between objects. They consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Understanding graph representation and traversal is critical for interviews.

## Learning Objectives
- Build an adjacency list from edges
- Implement DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Implement BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Determine connectivity between nodes

## Concepts
1. **Adjacency List**: Map each node to its list of neighbors
2. **DFS**: Go deep before wide, uses stack/recursion
3. **BFS**: Go wide before deep, uses queue
4. **Path Finding**: Traverse and track visited nodes

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- "exercises/19-graphs/1-graph-fundamentals/solution.test.js"
```

## Difficulty: Medium
