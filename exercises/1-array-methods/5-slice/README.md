# Array Method: slice()

## Overview
The `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array selected from a start to an end index (end not included).

## Key Concepts
- Returns a **new array** (shallow copy)
- Does **not mutate** the original array
- Takes two parameters: `start` and `end` (optional)
- Negative indices count from the end of the array
- If `end` is omitted, slice goes to the end
