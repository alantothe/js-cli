# Spread Operator

## Overview
The spread operator (`...`) allows an iterable (like an array or string) to be expanded in places where zero or more elements are expected.

## Key Concepts
- Unpacks array elements into individual values
- Useful for **copying arrays** without mutation
- Can **combine multiple arrays** efficiently
- Works in function calls, array literals, and object literals
- Creates a **shallow copy** (good for immutability patterns)

## Exercises
This exercise file contains problems to practice the spread operator for working with arrays functionally.

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- "solution.test.js"
```

## Difficulty
**Medium**
