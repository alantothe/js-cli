# Array Method: filter()

## Overview
The `filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

## Key Concepts
- Returns a new array (possibly smaller than the original)
- The original array is **not mutated**
- Only elements where the callback returns **truthy** are included
- If no elements pass, returns an empty array

## Exercises
