# Array Method: reduce()

## Overview
The `reduce()` method executes a reducer function on each element of an array, resulting in a single value.

## Key Concepts
- Returns a **single value** (not an array)
- The reducer function takes an **accumulator** and a **current element**
- Can have an **initial value** for the accumulator
- Useful for summing, counting, or building complex objects
