# Array Method: forEach()

## Overview
The `forEach()` method executes a provided function once for each array element.

## Key Concepts
- Does **not return** a value (returns `undefined`)
- Used for **side effects** (logging, modifying external state)
- Cannot break out early (unlike a for loop)
- Does **not mutate** the original array
- Callback receives: `element`, `index`, `array`

## Exercises
This exercise file contains problems to practice the `forEach()` method for iterating and executing side effects.

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- "solution.test.js"
```

## Difficulty
