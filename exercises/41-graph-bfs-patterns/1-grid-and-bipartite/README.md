# Grid & Bipartite BFS

## Overview
Graph BFS patterns show up constantly: grids, levels, and graph coloring.

## Learning Objectives
- Multi-source BFS for matrix distance problems
- Rotting oranges style level-by-level simulation
- Check bipartite graph by coloring
- Shortest path in binary matrix

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- "exercises/41-graph-bfs-patterns/1-grid-and-bipartite/solution.test.js"
```

## Difficulty: Medium
