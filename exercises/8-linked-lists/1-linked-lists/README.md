# Linked Lists

## Overview
A linked list is a data structure where each node contains data and a link to the next node.

## Key Concepts
- Node: contains data and `next` pointer
- Singly linked list: each node points to one next node
- Traversal: visiting each node from head to tail
- Insertion and deletion require updating pointers
- More flexible than arrays for dynamic data

## Run Tests
```bash
npm test -- "solution.test.js"
```

## Difficulty
